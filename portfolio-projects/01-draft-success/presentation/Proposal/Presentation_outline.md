Title: Where do franchise players come from?
Description: Some teams like the cowboys have an incredible record of drafting Hall of Famers, All-Pros, and Pro-Bowlers and making less big blockbuster trades or relying on free agency to pickup key franchise players. This analysis looks into where some of the best players in the league get drafted and how that connects to the Cowboys past draft strategies.

The reason for this research stems from Will McClay’s exceptional draft strategy for the Dallas Cowboys, where he consistently selects highly valuable players throughout the draft. Over the past decade, the Cowboys have drafted 12 All-Pro selections (seven unique) and 24 Pro Bowl selections (13 unique), potentially including a few Hall of Famers. The Dallas Cowboys’ drafting prowess over the last decade (2015-2024 drafts) is evident in their ranking as the NFL leader in total snaps played (91,901) by homegrown players they drafted and retained on their own roster for the subsequent five years (through 2023).

Im looking to use different data from Drafts, combines, and the NFL 100 to look at position based drafted by round to look at where these players are drafted. Can you get the best players not in the first round and if so how many dont come from the first round. I want to prep all the raw data to look for answers to my question. 

I will evaluate this by looking deeply into how the draft works and how teams select players and when they plan to draft them. Using this i can look at where and how high value players slip later into the draft.

The process i will take is to research the draft boards and data from pro-football-reference and NFL website to get the data needed. Then i will process the data to clean any missing info and make it easy to load into visualiztion. After that making some charts and tables of all the positions drafted and in what round. I think i will want to look at the percentages of the NFL 100 players as a reference for franchise caliber players. This NFL 100 list is made every year before the season starts of the 100 best players.
